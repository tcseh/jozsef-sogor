## Summary

The goal of this programming exercise is to create a single page app to display and search Start Wars characters using [Swapi](https://swapi.dev/).

You can use any Front-end framework (Angular preferably, React, Vuejs etc.)
You should create a design too in any interface design tool (Figma preferably, Sketch, InVision etc).

## Requirements
- On page load display all characters returned from the endpoint `https://swapi.dev/api/people/`
  - Display the visible amount shown and the max result count
- Add a select so the user can sort the results by:
  - A-Z
  - Z-A
  - Male
  - Female
- Add a details view so the user can see more information about the selected character (e.g.: height, mass, hair_color, number of films)
- BONUS: Add a search bar to the top of the page. When a user types a character name and clicks search, it should call `https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=` and update the results.
- The page should be responsive, ensure the layout looks respectable on mobile and tablet viewpoints.
- Open a pull request with the link to the design

## What we will evaluate

- Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, among other factors.
- The git history will be evaluated.
- Our tech stack here is Angular, NGRX, Nx, SCSS and Bootstrap, we would like you to use the same stack, but it's ok if you use a different one.

## Suggestions

- The search feature is a BONUS, spend time on it only if you have some extra.
- It is not a problem if you run out of time, at the end of the allocated timeslot open a pull request with what you have by then
- Some parts of the exercise are deliberately not defined properly, so that you have some freedom to decide ( with this we are testing your decisions, as well ;) )

In case you have any questions regarding the data or the task itself, feel free to reach out to Tam√°s Cseh ( tcseh@iquantsolutions.com ).

Many thanks for taking the time and for dedicating effort to the exercise.
